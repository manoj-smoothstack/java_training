/**
 * A common use case when dealing with numbers is working with ranges of numeric values.
 * For example, suppose youâ€™d like to generate all numbers between 1 and 100.
 * Java 8 introduces two static methods available on IntStream and LongStream to help
 * generate such ranges: range and rangeClosed. Both methods take the starting value of the
 * range as the first parameter and the end value of the range as the second parameter.
 * But range is exclusive, whereas rangeClosed is inclusive. Letâ€™s look at an example:

    public NumericRanges() {
        numericRange();
    }

    /**
     * Here you use the rangeClosed method to generate a range of all numbers from 1 to 100.
     * It produces a stream so you can chain the filter method to select only even numbers.
     * At this stage no computation has been done. Finally, you call count on the resulting
     * stream. Because count is a terminal operation, it will process the stream and return
     * the result 50, which is the number of even numbers from 1 to 100, inclusive. Note
     * that by comparison, if you were using IntStream.range(1, 100) instead, the result
     * would be 49 even numbers because range is exclusive.
