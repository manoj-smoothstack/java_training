== Spring Data JDBC How To Bidirectional Internal Relationship

An internal relationship is one that links entities within an aggregate.

Instead you may choose to maintain the reverse relationship while creating the aggregate.
This takes care of the construction during initial creation or modification of the aggregate, and also of the construction when loading an aggregate from the database.
